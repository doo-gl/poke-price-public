To get bitmap fonts working, start with a ttf file
go here: https://snowb.org/
Set the size / colour / letters you want to use
Export as fnt TXT format (Jimp doesn't do xml)
save to this dir
in the .fnt file, make sure it is referencing the png file by the correct name if you have renamed the file
